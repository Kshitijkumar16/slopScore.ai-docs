# Introduction

This document serves as the "North Star" for the SlopScore.ai project.

It defines exactly what we are building, why we are building it, and what success looks like for our hackathon MVP.

## Slopscore.ai

**SlopScore.ai** is an `agentic verification engine` designed to "restore trust" in YouTube content.

- In an era where AI content farms ("AI Slop") can produce professional-looking videos at scale, visual quality is no longer a proxy for truth.
- SlopScore.ai acts as a professional fact-checker to verify claims and citations in real-time.

## What It Does

Instead of guessing if a video was made by AI, SlopScore.ai analyzes the **informational integrity** of the content:

1.  **`Verifies Claims:`** Extracts factual assertions from the transcript and cross-references them against authoritative databases (Google Fact Check, Reuters, etc.) along with web search for fact-checking.
2.  **`Traces Citations:`** Follows links in the description to determine if they lead to credible primary sources or circular "content farm" loops.
3.  **`Scores Credibility:`** Generates a transparency report based on evidence, not AI detection probabilities.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation serves as the "Holy Bible" for us.

- **[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/mission):** Our core philosophy ("Accuracy > Authorship"), definition of "Slop," and the strict MVP scope for the hackathon.
- **[Architecture](/docs/architecture/system-overview):** The high-level system design, tech stack (Next.js, LangChain, Convex), and data flow.
- **[Agents](/docs/agents/supervisor):** Detailed logic for our multi-agent system, including the Claim Verifier and Citation Tracer.
- **[Tools & Integrations](/docs/tools-and-integrations/brave-search-tool):** Reference guides for the APIs we use (Brave Search, Google Fact Check).
- **[Pitch & Defence](/docs/pitch/the-narrative):** Preparation for the judges, including our demo script and Q&A strategy.

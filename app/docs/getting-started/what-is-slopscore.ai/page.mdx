# What is SlopScore.ai?

**SlopScore.ai** is an `Agentic Verification Engine` designed to verify YouTube content in real-time. It is a browser extension and web platform that automates the research process professional fact-checkers use to validate information.

## What It Does

Instead of guessing if a video was made by AI, SlopScore.ai analyzes the `informational integrity of the content`. It answers three questions:

1.  Are the claims factually true?
2.  Do the cited sources actually exist and support the claims?
3.  Is the video part of a circular misinformation loop?

## Core Methodology

**Independent Cross-Verification**: Professional fact-checkers do not rely on the content itself to verify truth. Instead, they leave the source to investigate what other, trusted sources say about the topic. SlopScore.ai automates this research workflow using autonomous AI agents.

### The Workflow

When a user analyzes a video, our system performs the following steps in parallel:

1.  `Transcript Extraction`: We fetch the full text of the video.
2.  `Claim Extraction`: An AI agent identifies verifiable factual assertions (ignoring opinions).
3.  Cross-Examination:
    - `The Claim Verifier`: Queries the Google Fact Check Tools API and Brave Search to find consensus on the claims from high-authority domains (Reuters, NASA, .edu sites). If not found, we just use Brave Search to find authoritative sources, and cross-check if the content from the video matches these sources.
    - `The Citation Tracer`: Extracts links from the description and traces them 2-3 levels deep. It checks if Source A cites Source B, source B sites source C and if Source C cites Source A (a circular loop).
4.  `Synthesis`: The system compiles a "Trust Report" and calculates a SlopScore (0-100) based on evidence, not vibes.

## Why Not Just Use an AI Detector?

Existing tools (GPTZero, Copyleaks) focus on syntax (how sentences are constructed).
SlopScore.ai focuses on semantics (what the sentences actually mean).

| Feature       | Standard AI Detectors                | SlopScore.ai                                        |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Focus         | AI Writing Style                     | Factual Accuracy & Evidence                         |
| Failure Mode  | Flags non-native speakers as AI      | Flags verified facts as True (regardless of author) |
| Output        | "98% AI Probability"                 | "Claim contradicted by NASA"                        |
| Actionability | Low (What do I do with probability?) | High (I can see the proof)                          |

## `The Vision` (i just like to repeat this)

We are building `middleware for trust`. In a future where most content will be AI-generated, users need a tool that filters for accuracy, **ensuring that the efficiency of AI doesn't come at the cost of truth**.

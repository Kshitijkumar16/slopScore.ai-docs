# SlopScore.ai

### I'm emphasizing the three layers: content hallucinations, citation issues, and deceptive presentation, all feeding into an echo chamber effect.

My solution's North Star is taking shape as an automated fact-checker that leverages "Lateral Reading" for evidence-based verification, not just a simple score.

Automated Verification

1. The Problem Statement

"The AI-Citing-AI Echo Chamber"
YouTube is being flooded with "AI Slop"—content that looks professional (slick thumbnails, confident voiceovers) but contains hallucinated facts and cites other AI-generated articles as evidence.

The User Pain: Users cannot distinguish between a well-researched video and an AI hallucination without spending hours manually fact-checking.

The Systemic Risk: We are entering a loop where AI cites AI, creating a "manufactured consensus" that effectively launders misinformation into "truth."

The Gap: Current tools only try to detect if AI wrote the text (which is prone to false positives). No tool currently automates the process of verifying if the claims are actually true.

Agentic Verification Engine.

Innovation: Uniqueness of the solution approach

Technical prowess: Quality and sophistication of implementation

Market potential: Commercial viability and scalability

You're creating a new category: YouTube Content Verification Tools.

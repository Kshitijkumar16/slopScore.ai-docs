# Our Mission

Clearly defining our mission is important for us to build the right product. Its important when judges ask us questions.

## The Core Philosophy: Accuracy > Authorship

We believe the fundamental question for the post-AI internet is not _"Did a robot write this?"_ but rather **_"Is this information accurate?"_**

### The Problem with "AI Detection"

Current tools (like GPTZero or Originality.ai) focus on detecting **authorship**. They look for linguistic patterns, burstiness, and perplexity. We are explicitly rejecting this approach because:

1.  **It is unreliable:** AI detection has high false-positive rates, often flagging non-native speakers or neurodivergent writers.
2.  **It is irrelevant:** A human can write a script full of lies. An AI can write a script full of verified facts.
3.  **It creates a false dichotomy:** It implies "Human = Good" and "AI = Bad," which is not true.

### Our Stance

**Truth matters more than the creator.** Our mission is to verify the _content_, not the _creator_. We judge a video based on the integrity of its claims and the credibility of its sources.

## The "Echo Chamber" Crisis

We are solving a specific, urgent systemic risk: **The AI-Citing-AI Loop.**

As AI tools become cheaper, content farms are generating thousands of articles and videos daily. To make this content look legitimate, these AI tools cite "sources." However, often:

1.  An AI writes a fake article.
2.  Another AI (or a lazy creator) cites that article as a source for a YouTube video.
3.  A viewer sees the citation and assumes the video is researched.
4.  **Result:** Misinformation is "laundered" into truth through a chain of circular citations.

**Our mission is to break this loop.**

## Hackathon Success Criteria (The Winning Condition)

To win MumbaiHacks, we are prioritizing **Depth** and **Evidence** over speed or visual flashiness.

**Our MVP succeeds if we can demonstrate:**

1.  **Chain Detection:** We must trace a link from a YouTube video to its source, and check if _that_ source is part of a low-quality content farm loop.
2.  **Factual Verification:** We must successfully extract claims and verify them against authoritative databases (Google Fact Check Tools, Reuters, etc.).
3.  **Zero Visual Analysis:** We will **not** analyze video frames or thumbnails. This is out of scope. We focus 100% on the script, the claims, and the citation links.

**The Pitch Narrative:**
"We don't tell you what to watch. We give you the context to decide. This is infrastructure for the post-AI internet."

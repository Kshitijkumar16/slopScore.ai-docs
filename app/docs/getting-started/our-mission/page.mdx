# Our Mission

Clearly defining our mission is important for us to build the right product. Clearly knowing our mission will help us answer any questions about our app a lot better and more confidently.

## AI Slop

We define AI Slop as `low-effort`, `unregulated content` that prioritizes quantity and engagement over factual accuracy.

**Slop** often looks professional. It can have high-quality voiceovers, 4K visuals, and confident narration.

But, just because a video looks good does not mean it is accurate. If a creator uses AI to generate a script without verifying the facts, it is Slop, regardless of the production value.

## The Problem: `The AI-Citing-AI Loop`

As AI tools become cheaper, "content farms" are generating thousands of articles and videos daily. To make this content look legitimate, these AI tools cite "sources."

**The Danger:**

1.  An AI writes a fake article.
2.  Another AI (or a lazy creator) cites that article as a source for a YouTube video.
3.  A viewer sees the citation and assumes the video is researched.
4.  **Result:** `Misinformation is "laundered"` into truth through a chain of circular citations.

## Our Philosophy

We are **not** building an AI Detector. We are **not** against the use of AI tools.

If a creator uses AI to write a script, but the facts are true and the sources are legitimate, that is **good content**.
If a human writes a script, but the facts are false and the sources are fake, that is **bad content**.

**Our Approach:**

- **Don't ask:** "Did an AI write this?" (This is unreliable and often irrelevant).
- **Ask:** "Is the information accurate? Do the citations actually exist? Are the sources credible?"

We focus entirely on the **information presented**, not the method of creation.

`Accuracy > Authorship`

## The Vision

We are building `middleware for trust`. In a future where most content will be AI-generated, users need a tool that filters for accuracy, **ensuring that the efficiency of AI doesn't come at the cost of truth**.

## Success Criteria

To win this hackathon, we are prioritizing `Accuracy` and `Depth` over speed or visual flashiness.

The MVP must demonstrate:

1.  `Chain Detection`: We must be able to trace a link from a YouTube video to its source, and check if _that_ source is part of a low-quality content farm loop.
2.  `Factual Verification`: We must successfully extract claims and verify them against authoritative databases (like Google Fact Check Tools) along with checking correctness of the information using Brave Search.
3.  `Zero Visual Analysis`: We will **not** analyze video frames or thumbnails. This is out of scope. We focus 100% on the script, the claims, and the citation links.

## Winning Condition:

> **The project succeeds if we can show the judges a "high-production" YouTube video and prove, through data, that its sources are circular and its claims are false.**

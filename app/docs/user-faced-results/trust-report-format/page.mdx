# Trust Report Format

The **Trust Report** is the `final output` presented to the user. It is designed to answer three questions in under 30 seconds:

1.  **Should I trust this?** (The Score)
2.  **Why?** (The Summary)
3.  **Prove it.** (The Evidence)

---

## The Hero Section (One line Verdict)

The top of the report provides an `immediate, high-level assessment` of the video's informational integrity.

### The SlopScore

A dynamic meter ranging from **0 to 100**.

- **0-29 (🟢 Green):** **`VERIFIED`**. The video cites authoritative sources and claims align with consensus.
- **30-59 (🟡 Yellow):** **`CAUTION`**. Mixed accuracy. The video may have valid points but relies on weak sources or contains unverified claims.
- **60-100 (🔴 Red):** **`HIGH RISK`**. Significant density of falsehoods, hallucinations, or circular citations.

### The "Why" Summary

A generated one-sentence explanation of the score, preventing the "Black Box" problem.

> _Example: "This video makes 12 factual claims. 3 are directly contradicted by NASA data, and the primary source cited is a known content farm."_

## Claim Analysis (The "Fact Check")

This section lists the specific factual assertions extracted from the video transcript. We prioritize **quality over quantity**, showing the top 5-8 most significant claims.

### UI Components per Claim:

1.  **`The Quote:`** The exact text extracted from the transcript.
2.  **`The Status Badge:`**
    - `✅ TRUE`: Supported by multiple authoritative sources.
    - `❌ FALSE`: Contradicted by a high-authority source.
    - `⚠️ UNVERIFIED`: No reliable evidence found (neither true nor false).
    - `👻 HALLUCINATED`: The video attributes this claim to a source (e.g., "Harvard says..."), but the source has no record of it.
3.  **`The Evidence Link:`** A direct link to the source used to verify/debunk the claim (e.g., a Reuters article or Google Fact Check entry).

```ts filename="/example-claim-data.ts" copy
// Example Data Structure for UI
const returning_claims = [
  {
    claim: "Eating dirt cures immunity",
    status: "FALSE",
    evidence: {
      source: "Mayo Clinic",
      url: "https://mayoclinic.org/dirt-myth",
    snippet: "There is no scientific evidence supporting soil ingestion..."
  }
}
```

## Citation Audit (The "Echo Chamber" Detector)

This section visualizes the `Paper Trail` of the video.<br/>
**It answers:** `Where is this information coming from?`

### Source Indicators

We analyze every link in the description and every verbally mentioned source.

- `🟢 Authoritative`: Link goes to a .gov, .edu, or verified news domain.
- `🟡 Low Credibility`: Link goes to a domain registered < 6 month ago (common for AI content farms).
- `⚠️ Broken Link`: 404 Error (indicates low effort/maintenance).
- `🚨 Echo Chamber` (The "Wow" Feature):
  - Definition: Source A cites Source B, and Source B cites Source C and Source C sites source A.
  - UI Representation: A warning badge labeled "Circular Citation Detected". This is a definitive sign of manufactured consensus.

## Transparency Check

A breakdown of how open the creator is about their sources.

- `"Trust Me Bro"`: If a video makes factual claims (Science/News) but provides zero links or verbal citations, this section flags a Transparency Gap.
- `Vague Attribution`: Penalizes phrases like "Scientists say" without naming the scientists.

---

## How to Interpret "False Positives"

We explicitly design the UI to handle nuance.

- `Scenario`: A video debunks a conspiracy theory. It mentions the false claim in order to disprove it.
- `Risk`: Our agent might flag the false claim as "False" and penalize the video.
- `Mitigation`: The Context Awareness in our prompt engineering looks for "Negation" (e.g., "It is not true that...").
- `User Override`: The UI includes a `"Report Error"` button. If a user flags a false positive, it helps tune our prompts.

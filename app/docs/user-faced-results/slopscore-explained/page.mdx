# SlopScore Explained

The **SlopScore** is a measure of **informational risk**. Unlike other tools that guess _who_ wrote the content, we measure _how accurate and transparent_ the content is.

Unlike simple "AI detectors" that guess authorship, SlopScore calculates the **density of misinformation** relative to the total volume of content. This ensures that a long, well-researched video isn't unfairly penalized for a single minor error, while a short video filled with hallucinations is correctly flagged.

## The User Psychology

When a user clicks "Analyse," they have 3 specific questions, in this order:

1. `The Verdict`: "Is this video BS or safe?" (Instant gratification).
2. `The Proof`: "Why do you say that?" (Skepticism).
3. `The Depth`: "Show me the sources so I can check myself." (Verification).

---

## The Core Formula

The SlopScore is a weighted aggregate of three verified dimensions:

```ts filename="/slopScore.ts" copy
let claimScore = 0,
  sourceScore = 0,
  transparencyScore = 0;

const slopScore =
  claimScore * 0.6 + sourceScore * 0.3 + transparencyScore * 0.1;
```

Where:

- **ClaimScore:** The proportion of claims found to be false or hallucinated. (60% Weight).
- **SourceScore:** The health and integrity of the citation network. (30% Weight).
- **TransparencyScore:** A baseline check on metadata and disclosure. (10% Weight).

---

## 1. The Claim Score - 60% Weight

This is the most important metric. It measures the **Accuracy Ratio**. We do not just count errors; we measure the **density of error** adjusted for the agent's confidence.

### The Logic

```ts filename="/claimScore.ts" copy
const claimScore = (sum(severity * confidence) / totalClaimsChecked) * 100;
```

### Severity Weights

Not all errors are equal.

| Severity Level    | Weight  | Description                                                                          |
| :---------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hallucination** | **1.0** | Claiming a source said X when they didn't, or inventing a source. This is peak Slop. |
| **Proven False**  | **0.8** | Direct contradiction by a high-authority source (e.g., Reuters/NASA).                |
| **Unverified**    | **0.2** | No evidence found (neutral/slight risk).                                             |
| **True**          | **0.0** | Verified fact (reduces the average).                                                 |

### Why this is Robust:

- **Video A (100 Claims, 2 False):** `(2 * 0.8) / 100 = 0.016` → **Claim Score: 1.6** (Very Low Risk).
- **Video B (5 Claims, 2 False):** `(2 * 0.8) / 5 = 0.32` → **Claim Score: 32** (Medium Risk).

_The score scales with the content volume._

---

## 2. The Source Score - 30% Weight

This measures the **Network Integrity**. It checks if the video exists in an informational vacuum or an echo chamber.

### The Logic

```ts filename="/sourceScore.ts" copy
const sourceScore = baseIntegrity + echoPenalty - authorityBonus;
```

### Source Score Calculation

The Source Score ranges from **0 (Perfect Sources)** to **100 (Toxic Sources)**.
It is calculated using a **Points Accumulation System**. We start at **0** and add penalties for bad links or subtract bonuses for good links.

#### The Point System

We analyze every unique link found in the video description.

| Link Type             | Points Added/Subtracted   | Reason                                                                           |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🔗 Broken Link**    | **+10 points** (per link) | Indicates 404/Dead link. Shows negligence or lack of maintenance.                |
| **👶 Fresh Domain**   | **+25 points** (per link) | Domain registered < 30 days ago. High probability of disposable content farm.    |
| **🛡️ Authority Link** | **-15 points** (per link) | Link to `.gov`, `.edu`, `nature.com`, `reuters.com`, etc. Validates credibility. |
| **😐 Neutral Link**   | **0 points**              | Standard blogs, social media, or unverified news sites.                          |
| **🔄 Echo Loop**      | **FORCE SCORE TO 100**    | **Critical Failure.** Source A cites Source B, and Source B cites Source A.      |

## 3. The Transparency Score - 10% Weight

This measures **intent**. Good research typically shows its work.

- **No Sources Provided:** Score = 100 (Max penalty).
- **Vague Attribution:** Score = 50 (e.g., "Scientists say..." vs "Dr. Smith says...").
- **Full Transparency:** Score = 0.

## Scenario Simulation

Let's see how this robust math handles two different edge cases.

### Scenario A: The "Gold Standard" (Educational Channel)

_A 15-minute video about physics. 10 claims made. 3 authoritative sources cited._

**Claims (10 Total):**

- 10 Verified True.
- **ClaimScore:** `(0 / 10) * 100 = 0`

**Sources:**

- Link 1: `nasa.gov` (Authority: -15)
- Link 2: `arxiv.org` (Authority: -15)
- Link 3: `wikipedia.org` (Authority: -15)
- **SourceScore:** `0 - 45 = -45` (Clamped to 0).

**Transparency:**

- Links provided.
- **TransparencyScore:** `0`

**Final Calculation:**

```
(0 * 0.6) + (0 * 0.3) + (0 * 0.1) = 0
```

**Verdict:** 🟢 **VERIFIED (Score: 0/100)**
_Result: Perfect score. The system rewards high-quality research._

---

### Scenario B: The "Lazy Creator" (Broken Links)

_A tech tutorial. Accurate info, but the creator linked to a dead page and a personal blog._

**Claims (5 Total):**

- 4 Verified True.
- 1 Unverified (Niche technical claim).
- **ClaimScore:** `((1 * 0.2) / 5) * 100 = 4`

**Sources:**

- Link 1: `github.com` (Neutral: 0)
- Link 2: `old-docs.com` (Broken/404: +10)
- **SourceScore:** `0 + 0 + 10 = 10`

**Transparency:**

- Links provided.
- **TransparencyScore:** `0`

**Final Calculation:**

```
(4 * 0.6) + (10 * 0.3) + (0 * 0.1) = 2.4 + 3 = 5.4
```

**Verdict:** 🟢 **VERIFIED (Score: 5/100)**
_Result: The system is forgiving. A broken link is sloppy, not malicious. It doesn't trigger a red flag._

---

### Scenario C: The "Trust Me Bro" (No Sources)

_A health advice video. Makes bold claims but provides zero links in the description._

**Claims (8 Total):**

- 6 Verified True.
- 2 Verified False (Contradicted by medical consensus).
- **ClaimScore:** `((2 * 0.8) / 8) * 100 = 20`

**Sources:**

- None provided.
- **SourceScore:** 0 (Skipped).

**Transparency:**

- No sources provided.
- **TransparencyScore:** `100` (Max Penalty).

**Final Calculation:**

```
(20 * 0.6) + (0 * 0.3) + (100 * 0.1) = 12 + 0 + 10 = 22
```

**Verdict:** 🟢 **VERIFIED (Score: 22/100)**
_Result: Even though the score is Green, the UI will show a specific "Transparency Warning." If the claims were worse (e.g., 4 False), this would quickly tip into Yellow._

---

### Scenario D: The "Content Farm" (Fresh Domains)

_A breaking news video using AI voiceover. Cites a website created 3 days ago._

**Claims (4 Total):**

- 2 True.
- 1 Unverified.
- 1 Hallucinated Source (Cites a study that doesn't exist).
- **ClaimScore:** `((1 * 0.2) + (1 * 1.0)) / 4 * 100 = 30`

**Sources:**

- Link 1: `daily-breaking-24.xyz` (Fresh Domain: +25).
- **SourceScore:** `25`

**Transparency:**

- Links provided.
- **TransparencyScore:** `0`

**Final Calculation:**

```
(30 * 0.6) + (25 * 0.3) + (0 * 0.1) = 18 + 7.5 = 25.5
```

**Verdict:** 🟢 **VERIFIED (Score: 26/100)**
_Wait, why is this Green? Because only 1 of 4 claims was hallucinated. If the video was pure misinformation (e.g., 3/4 claims false), the Claim Score would spike to 60+, pushing the total into Caution. This proves the system is conservative—it needs strong evidence to flag content._

---

### Scenario E: The "Echo Chamber" (Circular Loop)

_A conspiracy theory video. Cites a blog that cites the video back._

\*\*Claims (6 Total):

- 3 Unverified (Vague theories).
- 3 False (Contradicted by data).
- **ClaimScore:** `((3 * 0.2) + (3 * 0.8)) / 6 * 100 = 50`

**Sources:**

- Link 1: `truth-uncovered.net`
- Check: `truth-uncovered.net` cites the YouTube channel.
- **SourceScore:** `100` (Echo Chamber Penalty).

**Transparency:**

- Links provided.
- **TransparencyScore:** `0`

**Final Calculation:**

```
(50 * 0.6) + (100 * 0.3) + (0 * 0.1) = 30 + 30 = 60
```

**Verdict:** 🔴 **HIGH RISK (Score: 60/100)**
_Result: The circular citation is the smoking gun. It instantly pushes a "borderline" video into the Red zone._

---

## Why Transparency Matters?

The logic for including Transparency—even at a low 10% weight—is based on **Information Accountability**.

### 1. The "Burden of Proof" Principle

- **Logic:** A video that hides its sources is inherently riskier than one that shows its work. Even if the facts turn out to be true, the process was opaque.

### 2. A Proxy for "Low-Effort" AI

- **Logic:** Most "Slop Farms" skip the citation step because it kills their automation speed. Therefore, a lack of transparency is a strong statistical proxy for low-effort, mass-produced content.

### 3. Protecting the "Citation Tracer"

- **Logic:** We cannot verify the source network if no network is provided. The Transparency Score acts as a small penalty for "blinding" the verification system.

### 4. Why only 10%? (The Safety Valve)

We keep the weight low (10%) to protect lazy but honest creators.

**Scenario:** A Professor records a lecture. Everything they say is true. They provide no links because they are old-school.

- **Claim Score:** 0 (All True).
- **Source Score:** 0 (Skipped).
- **Transparency Score:** 100 (Max Penalty).
- **Final SlopScore:** `(0 * 0.6) + (0 * 0.3) + (100 * 0.1) = 10`
- **Verdict:** 🟢 **VERIFIED (Score: 10/100)**

**Logic:** The penalty is just enough to prevent a "Perfect 0" score (because they weren't transparent), but not enough to falsely flag them as Slop.

Transparency measures **Intent**.

- **Good Faith:** "Here are my sources, check me."
- **Bad Faith:** "Trust me, bro."

We penalize the "Trust me, bro" approach because in the age of AI hallucinations, blind trust is dangerous.

# Tech Stack

We have chosen a "`Lean & Mean`" stack optimized for the 24-hour hackathon timeframe. We are sticking to a **Full-Stack TypeScript** environment to share types between the frontend, backend, and AI agents.

## Frontend (The Face)

We are building a **Web Application** first for the safest demo, with the architecture ready to port to a Chrome Extension.

- **`Next.js 14 (App Router)`**: The core framework. Handles the UI and the API routes for the agents.
- **`Tailwind CSS`**: For rapid UI styling.
- **`Lucide React`**: For status icons (e.g., 🟢 Verified, 🔴 Slop).
- **`Shadcn/UI`**: Pre-built accessible components (Accordions, Cards, Badges) to save design time.

## Browser Extension (If Time Permits)

- **`WXT`**: The modern framework for web extensions. It allows us to use the same React components from our Next.js app inside the Chrome side panel.

## Intelligence (The Brain)

- **`LangChain.js`**: The framework for interacting with LLMs and defining tools.
- **`LangGraph`**: Critical for our **Supervisor-Worker** architecture. It allows us to manage the state of the analysis (e.g., waiting for the Citation Agent to finish before calculating the final score).
- **`OpenAI (GPT-4o)`**: The underlying LLM for extraction, synthesis, and decision-making.

## Data & Tools (The Limbs)

These are the specific tools our agents use to gather evidence.

- **`youtube-transcript`**: A lightweight NPM package to scrape video transcripts without hitting YouTube API quotas.
- **`Google Fact Check Tools API`**: The "Source of Truth" for verifying viral claims.
- **`Brave Search API`**: The fallback for general web research and finding primary sources.
- **`Cheerio`**: For lightweight scraping of cited articles (used by the Citation Tracer to detect circular links).
- **`WHOIS API`** (or similar lightweight lookup): To check domain age.

## Infrastructure

- **`Vercel`**: Hosting for the Next.js app and Serverless Functions.

## Excluded (Out of Scope)

To maintain velocity, we are explicitly **NOT** using:

- **Database (Convex/Supabase):** We are building a stateless MVP. Analysis happens in real-time.
- **Python:** We are staying full-stack TypeScript to avoid context switching.
- **Vector DBs (Pinecone/Weaviate):** Not needed. We are doing direct verification, not RAG over a document set.
- **Visual Analysis Libraries:** No ffmpeg or computer vision tools.

# Tech Stack

We have chosen a "Lean & Mean" stack optimized for the 24-hour hackathon timeframe.

## Frontend (The Face)

- **`Next.js 14 (App Router)`**: Framework for the Web App.
- **`Tailwind CSS`**: For rapid UI styling (Trust Card components).
- **`Lucide React`**: For icons (Alert triangles, Checkmarks).
- **`Shadcn/UI`**: Pre-built components to save design time.

## Intelligence (The Brain)

- **`LangChain.js`**: Framework for interacting with LLMs.
- **`LangGraph`**: For orchestrating the stateful multi-agent workflow.
- **`Gemini 3 Pro`**: The underlying LLM for extraction and synthesis.

## Data & Tools (The Limbs)

- **`youtube-transcript`**: NPM package to scrape video text without API quotas.
- **`Google Fact Check Tools API`**: The source of truth for verification.
- **`Brave Search API`**: The fallback for general web research.
- **`Cheerio`**: For lightweight scraping of cited articles (to check titles/links).

## Infrastructure

- **`Vercel`**: Hosting for the Next.js app and API routes.

## Excluded (Out of Scope)

To maintain velocity, we are **NOT** using:

- _Convex / Supabase_ (No database required for MVP).
- _Python_ (We are staying full-stack TypeScript/JS for unified code).
- _Vector DBs_ (Pinecone/Qdrant) - Not needed for this specific logic.

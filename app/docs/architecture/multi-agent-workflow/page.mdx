# Multi-Agent Workflow

SlopScore.ai does not rely on a single LLM prompt to do everything. Instead, we use a **`Supervisor-Worker`** pattern powered by LangGraph. This allows us to separate concerns and prevent the "context window" from getting cluttered.

## The Supervisor Pattern

The **`Supervisor Agent`** is the manager. It does not do the research itself. Its job is to:

1.  Receive the user's video input.
2.  Decide which workers are needed (e.g., if there are no links in the description, it skips the Citation Agent).
3.  Route data to the workers.
4.  Synthesize their outputs into a final `SlopScore`.

## The Worker Agents

### 1. Claim Verifying Agent

- **Input:** Video Transcript.
- **Task:** Extract factual claims $\rightarrow$ Search Google Fact Check $\rightarrow$ Search Brave $\rightarrow$ Compare results.
- **Output:** List of claims with status (`TRUE`, `FALSE`, `UNVERIFIED`) and evidence links.

### 2. Citation Tracer Agent

- **Input:** Links from Video Description.
- **Task:** Visit the link $\rightarrow$ Check for circular references $\rightarrow$ Check if the site is a known content farm.
- **Output:** A `CitationMap` (not actually a map if its too consuming) showing if the sources are independent or circular.

### 3. Source Credibility Agent (formerly Author Reputation)

- **Input:** Channel Name & Source Domains.
- **Task:** Check domain age (WHOIS) and Channel history.
- **Output:** A `CredibilityScore` (0-100).

## Why This Approach?

| **Slow:** Runs step-by-step (A then B then C).           | **Fast:** Runs in parallel (A, B, and C at once).                           |
| **Fragile:** If one step fails, the whole thing crashes. | **Resilient:** If one agent fails, the Supervisor still reports the others. |
| ** rigid:** Hard to add new checks.                      | **Modular:** We can plug in a "Visual Agent" later without breaking code.   |
